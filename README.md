# Razor Pages & MediatR Lab Exercise

This is the beginnings of a crude address book application using ASP.NET Core and the MediatR library. I have the create and list actions coded. Please finish the edit & remove actions. Use the links for help and the create action as an example. You'll find the existing code in the /Pages/AddressBook folder.

- Goals:
 - Gain exposure to patterns and tools the development team frequently leverages.
 - Gauge ability to, with minimal direction, use available resources to complete a task in relatively short order.
 - Assess the quality and thoroughness of code submitted.
		 

Install (if needed), the dotnet core runtime & sdk: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0
